## Aim

This is a small yet useful kernel for providing an introduction to Artificial Neural Networks for people who want to begin their journey into the field of deep learning. For this, I have used Keras which is a high-level Neural Networks API built on top of low level neural networks APIs like Tensorflow and Theano. As it is high-level, many things are already taken care of therefore it is easy to work with and a great tool to start with. Here's the documentation for keras https://keras.io/

## what is deep learning

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. Itâ€™s achieving results that were not possible before


## what is ANN

An artificial neuron network (ANN) is a computational model based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks. Information that flows through the network affects the structure of the ANN because a neural network changes - or learns, in a sense - based on that input and output. ANNs are considered nonlinear statistical data modeling tools where the complex relationships between inputs and outputs are modeled or patterns are found. ANN is also known as a neural network.
